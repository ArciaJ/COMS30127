\subsection*{Introduction}
These notes are about the cerebellum and is partly based on \cite{Albus1971a}. I offer an error bounty of
between 20p and 2 pounds for mistakes. Contact me at
\texttt{conor.houghton@bristol.ac.uk} or come up after a lecture.

\subsection*{Anatomy of the cerebellum}
The cerebellum has a number of striking features; it has a more stereotypical structure than most brain area and this structure is conversed across species. It also has one of the brains largest cells, the Purkinje cell, and its most numerous, the granule cell. 

\begin{figure}

\end{center}
\caption{A drawing by Santiago Ram\'{o}n y Cajal of a Purkinje cell. [Picture taken from \texttt{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golgi's\_method}]\label{fig:PC}}
\end{figure}

Purkinje cells have a distinctive structure with a huge, highly
branched, but flat dendritic arbor, see Fig.~\ref{fig:PC}; this allows
an extensive connectivity with each Purkinje cell receiving inputs
from around 100,000 other cells. In the cerebellum the Purkinje cell
are lined up like pages in a book, with their arbors lying in parallel
planes. They receive two excitatory inputs, weak inputs from parallel
fibres, axons that run perpendicular to the planes of the Purkinje
cell dendritic arbors, and a strong input from a climbing fibre, a
single axon which winds around the Purkinje cell and makes multiple
contacts with it, see Fig.~\ref{fig:cerebellum}.


\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=11cm]{cerebellum.png}
\end{center}
\caption{A cartoon of the cerebellar circuitary. A vertical axon rises
  from each granule cells, splits once and then extends horizontally
  in two directions making connections with multiple Purkinje
  cells. Each Purkinje cell has its own climbing fiber which winds up
  around it.\label{fig:cerebellum}}
\end{figure}

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\caption{A schematic of the cerebellar circuit. The granule cells (GC) receive input from a diverse range of other parts of the brain along the mossy fibers (MF). Each granule cell will combine input from just three or four mossy fibers and do this in lots of different combinations. The parallel fiber (PF) carries spikes from the GC to the Purkinje cell (PC). The PC also receives input from a climbing fiber (CF) coming from Inferior Olivary Nucleus (IO). In turn it sends an inhibitory signal to the Deep Cerebellar Nucleus (DCN).\label{fig:connectivity}}
\end{figure}

Another peculiarity is that the Purkinje cell has different responses to different inputs; in response to multiple weak inputs from the parallel fibers it fires a normal sort of spike, called in this context a \textsl{simple spike}; in response to single spike from the climbing fiber is fires a special spike, called a \textsl{complex spike}, with a leading spike, a number of small \lq{}spikelets\rq{} and a sustained after-period of depolarization; this is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:spikes}.

\caption{A complex spike. This drawing shows a simple
spikes in black and a complex spike in red. The
complex spike is followed by a long refractory
period during which spiking is not possible. This is
a sketch, not an actual recording, but a typical time
scale would have this refractory period 50 ms long.\label{fig:spikes}}

\subsection*{The Marr-Albus model}

It is still unclear exactly what the cerebellum does; what is known is
that it is important for actions, fine motor control and
proprioception; problems with the cerebellum are associated with
ataxia, loss of fine motor control, poor motor learning and poor
balance. There is a specific gait associated with cerebellar damage,
one that exhibits a certain self-consciousness or vigilance is
required for movement. According to most ideas about cerebellar
function it is required for the calculation of fine motor signals
\cite{Albus1971a}, or for predicting the sensory or proprioceptive
consequences of motor actions \cite{GaoEtAl1996a}.

Whatever exactly it does, it is widely believed, in accordance with
the Marr-Albus model \cite{Marr1969a,Albus1971a}, that the connections
from parallel fibers to Purkinje cells acts as a perceptron. Thus, if
$y$ is the output of the Purkinje cell and, in this simple model,
taking into account the fact Purkinje cells are inhibitory
\begin{equation}
y=-\sum{w_ix_i}
\end{equation}
where the $x_i$s are the activities in the parallel fibers and $w_i$
is the strength of the synapse from the $i$th climbing fiber to the
Purkinje cell. According to the perceptron rule there is a desired output $d$ and the synapses are adjusted according to
\begin{equation}
\Delta w_i=-\eta (d-y)x_i
\end{equation}
where $\eta$ is a small learning rate. The idea in the Marr-Albus
model is that the climbing fiber carries the error signal $d-y$.

Thus, in a simple example, say $\mathbf{w}=(1,1,1,1)$ initially and
the input $\mathbf{x}=(1,0,1,0)$ has the desired output $d=-1$, well
\begin{equation}
y=-\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x}=-2
\end{equation}
so $d-y=1$ and $\Delta\mathbf{w}=-\eta(1,0,1,0)$, so if $\eta=0.25$ after learning we would have $\mathbf{w}=(0.75,1,0.75,1)$ so
\begin{equation}
y=-\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x}=-1.5
\end{equation}
and the error has fallen to $d-y=0.5$. Conversely, imagine
$\mathbf{w}=(1,1,1,1)$ but $\mathbf{x}=(1,1,0,0)$ is intended to
represent $d=-3$, here
\begin{equation}
y=-\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x}=-2
\end{equation}
so $d-y=-1$ and $\Delta\mathbf{w}=-\eta(-1,-1,0,0)$ and after learning
with $\eta=0.25$ we would have $\mathbf{w}=(1.25,1.25,1,1)$. In other
words, we need both positive and negative errors with positive errors
associated with synaptic depression and negative errors with synaptic
potentiation; these have been observed experimentally
\cite{ItoEtAl1982a,DeanEtAl2010a} with climbing fibre activity greater
than or less than average corresponding to decreases and increases in
synapse strengths.

This can only be part of the description of this network. For example,
synapses form the parallel fibers can only be positive, not negative;
this can be accounted for by including inhibitory cells in the
network. Furthermore, a linear model like that being used here can't learn complicated patterns like the XOR pattern:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{llr}
$x_1$&$x_2$&$d$\\
\hline\\
0&0&0\\
0&1&-1\\
1&0&-1\\
1&1&0
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Learning a pattern like this requires a network with more than one
layer; in fact, this is already provided by the granule cell
layer. Each granule cell receives input from between one and seven
mossy fibers, there are $3\times 10^{11}$ granule cells, roughly 100
to 150 times the number of mossy fibers. Finally there are large
inhibitory cells called Golgi cells in the network, these have long
time constants, providing delays; this is clearly useful for motor
control where different muscles move at different times or different
motor consequence unfold at different times during a motion \cite{Fujita1982a,ShidaraEtAl1993a}.

This leaves lots of things mysterious; how this needs to be changed to
account for real spiking neurons, how the error signal adjusts the
synapse strengths and why this very special architecture is ideal for
this sort of calculation. Another question relates to the error; our
brain sees muscles and nerves, our observation sees objects and
motion, how are the two reconciled: when you throw a dart you can see
you hit the one instead of the triple 20, you can't see which finger
muscle was activated too strongly or too weakly. However, with a low
learning rate $d$, or even $d-y$ isn't needed exactly, in fact, just
the sign is needed; that is something that could plausibly be deduced in cortex.
