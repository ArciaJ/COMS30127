This course this year will differ from previous years; this is to
reflect the introduction of the sibling course "Neural Information
Processing" and to refresh the course design. A course outline is
given in course_outline.pdf. The course will emphasis different
neuronal models and how they relate to different ideas about how the
brain performs its function.
