1)

a) peristimulus time histogram
b) cross-correlogram 
c) d'
d) auto-correlogram



2) Aphasia

3) H(W)-H(W|S)  - not covered in 2015

4) The sodium channels is transient, the allows positive ions to flow in, the potassium channel is persistient, it allows positive ions to flow out.

5) sparse-small-small-error-sparse

6) The last answer, a neuron has only one type of synapse carrying the signal on. 

7) FTFTTF reading downwards

8) N

9) 0.25 

No learning rate is given so assume equilibrium values. In phase 1 S1 and S2 are presented together, so each has weight 0.5; when S1 and S3 are presented together 0.5 of the reward is unaccounted for, so each weight grows by 0.25, give S1 originally had 0.5 it now has 0.75 whereas S3 has 0.25. This is the predicted reward if S3 is presented alone.

10) D

11) 1.5

12) TTFT reading downwards

13) granule / cere / arallel / climbing

14) -68

15) soma / dendrites / axon / sodium 

16) animal is presented with an unexpected reward

17) creation of independent codes

18) hippocampus (dentate gyrus to be exact, though that's not asked for here)

19) 

Information about specific episodes is remembered in hippocampus
Generalities are extracted in neocortex
Independent representations are generated in hippocampus
Smaller learning rates are used in neocortex

20) 

increasing the membrane constant will decrease the firing rate
increasing the threshold will decrease the firing rate
increasing the reset value will increase the firing rate
increasing the injected current will increase the firing rate
