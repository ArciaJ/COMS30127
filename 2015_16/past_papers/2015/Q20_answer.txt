Sodium has a reversal potential at or above zero, so 

1) NO - see 4)

2) YES - as above.

3) YES - sodium flows into the cell both because of the chemical gradient and because a positive ion is attracted to the negative potential.

4) YES - sodium moves into the cell increasing its potential since
sodium is a positive ion.

5) YES - there are more sodiums outside the cell than in it/

6) NO - as above
