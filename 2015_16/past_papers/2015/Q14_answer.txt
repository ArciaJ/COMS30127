Bi and Poo's experimental results . . .  - NO, neurons which fire at
the same time acausally will have long term depression.

In Bi and Poo's experimental result a causal spike pair . . . YES,
this is exactly what they observe

Long term potentiation occurs when . . . NO, this is essentially a
garbled version of work on modification of STDP people have considered
but doesn't actually make sense.

In the plasticity experiment . . . YES, again this is what they
observe, long term plasticity is confined by the exponential window,
but depends on the sign.

Hebb said that if . . . YES, this is a direct quote, it includes the causal structure even though later use of the expression "Hebbian plasticity" left it out.

If a spike from Neuron A . . . NO, synapses never change from excitatory to inhibitory.
