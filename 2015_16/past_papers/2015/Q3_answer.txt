a dh/dt = -h +b

is solved by an integrating factor

dh/dt+h/a=f/a

d(h e^{t/a})dt=f/a e^{t/a}

then integrate both side, to give

h(t)= [h(0)-b]e^{-t/a} + b

which you can also see by noting the equilibrium value is b and for
t=0 h(t)=h(0)

The f is a typo which was corrected at the time of the exam.
