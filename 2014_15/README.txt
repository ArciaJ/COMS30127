Lecture notes for the 2014-15 version of the course. The folders
contain the individual sections of the course: the course is mostly
taught on the board from the notes given as a pdf in the folder, the
source folder contains the LaTeX file used to generate the pdf.

The file "lectures.org" will list which sections where taught in which
lectures.

A number of papers are references in the notes, I have tried to
collect them together in the folder "papers"; these are not required
reading but some of you might find them interesting.

There is an error bounty of between 20p and two pounds, if you spot an
error in any of the notes come up after a lecture or email me at
conor.houghton@bristol.ac.uk.
