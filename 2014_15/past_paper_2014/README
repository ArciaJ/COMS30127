Absurdly the software that runs the online exams does not seem to make
it possible to convert the exam to pdf; this is probably why it is not
available with the other past papers. It does allow me to 'try out'
the exam and the sample paper will be opened to you to try out nearer
the time; it does not seem possible to just open it up to you to try
out now. As a work around this folder includes screenshots of the
twenty questions in last years exam.
