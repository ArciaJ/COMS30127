The coursework is still being prepared; I will let you know when I
have a final version, but any change now will be cosmetic.

Submission is ready on SAFE and the deadline is Wednesday 23 March.  I
will arrange pre-submission feedback session in the week before that.

Sample code for the optional python background questions is available
in the code folder. Of course, there are lots of different ways to do
this.
